## Commands that I learnt

- git branch -m `<newbranchName>`

This renames the current checkouted branch.

- git log --oneline

Gives one line report of the commits.

- git log --graph

Gives information about the merging of branchs.

- git checkout `<commit hash>`

Navigates to the mentioned commit. Beware of its use cause it removes the change in the files. 

- git remote -v

This command will show fetch and push targets of the local repository.

- git remote remove origin
 
To remove remote.
